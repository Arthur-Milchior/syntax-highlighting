SyntaxHighlight
===============

Addon to add syntax highlighting to Anki

Changes in this branch
======================
* Option to turn off centering of code fragments
* Option to store the default language per deck
* Auto-update user config options on addon upgrade 
* Attempt to warn when config cannot be updated because deck hasn't been opened (Anki does not seem to persist these changes, investigating.. )
